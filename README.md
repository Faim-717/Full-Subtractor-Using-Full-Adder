# Full-Subtractor-Using-Full-Adder

This paper presents the design and implementation
of a full subtractor circuit using full adders as its fundamental
building blocks. A full subtractor is a crucial component in
digital arithmetic circuits, responsible for performing binary
subtraction operations. The proposed approach leverages the
structural similarity between full adders and full subtractors,
highlighting the potential for efficient utilization of resources
in digital designs. The paper commences with a comprehensive
review of basic binary subtraction principles, highlighting the
importance of borrow propagation and borrow generation in
designing efficient subtractor circuits. The structural equivalence
between full adders and full subtractors is then elaborated upon,
demonstrating how a full adder can be repurposed to function
as a full subtractor. This approach not only reduces design
complexity but also facilitates ease of integration within larger
digital systems.
